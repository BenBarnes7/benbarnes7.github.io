**PMI Guide to Business Analysis**

**4** **NEEDS ASSESSMENT**

 Is the process that guides investment decisions by organizations. During project work, these activities occur to ensure that organizational and business practices stay aligned. Needs Assessment activities are performed to assess the internal and external environments, and current capabilities of the organization to determine a set of viable solutions that would help the organizations business needs.

 Understanding business problems with stakeholders is important for all projects. How detailed a Needs Assessment Document needs to be is dependent on the organization&#39;s environment.

**4.1        IDENTIFY PROBLEM OR OPPORTUNITY**

 This process is the formation of an understanding of the situation that the organization is addressing. If a problem or opportunity is not thoroughly understood, the organization may pursue a solution that does not address the business need.

 Part of Needs Assessment is to identify the problem being solved or the opportunity that needs to be addressed. In order to avoid focusing on solutions early in the project, it is important to understand the current environment and business practices of the organization.

 Once a problem is understood, a situation statement is drafted by documenting the current problem that needs to be solved or opportunity that needs to be explored. Situation statement is reviewed and approved with key stakeholders to ensure that the solution has been correctly assessed.

  **Inputs:**

- **Assessment of Business Value:** reviewing business solutions to assess value
- **Elicitation Results:** from analysis and collaboration, elicitation results used to identify problem or solution may transition from confirmed to unconfirmed (possibly by Product Owner
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** are conditions not under immediate control of the team – i.e. contractual conditions, legal restrictions, or stakeholder expectations.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Benchmarking:** comparing organization&#39;s practices and processes against established standards.
- **Competitive Analysis:**
- **Document Analysis:** elicitation technique used to identify info relevant to requirements.
- Interviews: an approach to elicit info form stakeholders by asking questions and documenting responses.
- **Market Analysis:**
- **Prototyping:** a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected solution.

**Outputs:**

- **Business Need:** it provides the rationale for why organizational changes are proposed. Once defined, it is used to provide context when discussing future state, solution options, and business requirements.
- **Situation Statement:** an objective statement of a problem or opportunity of the situation&#39;s effect on the organization, and resulting impact.



**4.2         ASSESS CURRENT STATE**

 Is the process of examining the current environment from analysis to understand important organization factors, which may be the cause for a problem or opportunity. The key benefits of this process is that it provides sufficient understanding of the existing organizational state, and for determining which elements will remain changed or unchanged to achieve the future state. This process occurs in conjunction with Conduct Elicitation (6.3).

Business analysis activities should be focused on analyzing the areas relevant for defining the situation statement.

**4.3         DETERMINE FUTURE STATE**

 Is the process of determining gaps in existing capabilities and a set of proposed changes necessary to attain a desired future state that addresses the problem or opportunity under analysis. The key benefit of this process is the identification of the capabilities required for the transition from current to future state.

Involves conducting further elicitation to define changes to address what changes should stay and what capabilities should be added. The product team works through discussions using current state documentation to define what the future state will look like, including identifying capabilities and features of future state. Part of this analysis is obtaining an understanding on how users/stakeholders define value.

  **Inputs:**

- **Business Need:** It provides the rationale for why the organization desires a change. The business need provides the relevant data needed to formulate the desired future state.

**Outputs**

- **Business Goals And Objectives:**  identify what an organization wants a project to deliver and what goals and objective it wants to meet.
- **Required Capabilities and Features:** Identify the list of net changes the organization needs to obtain in order to achieve the desired future state.



**4.4         DETERMINE VIABLE OPTIONS &amp; PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS**

**       ** Is the process of applying various techniques to examine possible solutions to existing business problems that will meet organizational goals and objectives, and to determine which of the options are considered the best for the organization or development team to pursue. The key benefit of this process is that it validates the proposed solutions and promotes the best course of action for executives and decision makers to meet the business goals and objectives.

 Determining viable options encompasses discussions with stakeholders and product team members to perform further analysis for defining a list of possible solution recommendations to address the business need.

 The activity of evaluating factors of conducting feasibility analysis to determine the viability of product options may include: constraints, assumptions, dependencies, culture (organizational), operational and technology feasibility, supportability, cost-effectiveness feasibility, schedule feasibility, and validation.  Additional activities of Determine Viable Options &amp; Provide Recommendations are: defining product scope, defining high-level transition requirements, and recommending the most viable option.

**Inputs:**

- ****** Org Goals &amp; Objectives        :** identify what the business is expecting the product to deliver.
- **Required Capabilities and Features:** identify the list of net changes the organization is looking to obtain in order to achieve the desired future state. Each option will address capabilities differently. Initially, discussions regarding product scope should be at a high level. As options are formulated and refined, some may be determined to be more valuable than others.
- **Situation Statement:** is an objective statement of a problem or opportunity that includes a situation&#39;s effect on an organization, and resulting impact.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Benchmarking**
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
- **Elicitation Techniques:** Section 6

- **Group Decision-Making Techniques**
- ** Real Options:** is a technique to help teams determine when to make decisions, not how or why. This technique can be used on projects that follow an adaptive delivery model. The objective is to approach decision making by reducing the number of decisions that need to be made in the short term, and to delay other decisions as late as possible to allow the product team more time to discover and improve its knowledge base.

**       **

**Outputs:**

- **Feasibility Study Results:** are the summarized outcomes obtained from the completion of the feasibility analysis and are assembled in a package that is conducive to supporting executive review and decision making.

**4.5         FACILITATE PRODUCT ROADMAP DEVELOPMENT       **

**       **

**       ** Is the process of supporting the development of a product roadmap that outlines, at the high-level, which aspects of a product are planned for delivery over the course of a project, its iterations or releases, and the potential sequence for product delivery. The key benefit of the process is that it creates shared expectations among the stakeholders for the deliverables and potential order in which they will be delivered.

 In business analysis, product roadmaps provide important information about a product, providing insight about the product vision and how the product will support the organizational strategy, its business goals and objectives over time. The process of creating a Product Road map is a collaborative effort that brings together resources from the business/organization and development team to form a shared understanding of what is being requested and why. This process may include &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. Discussions begin at high level focusing on vision, and continues through lower levels of detail.

 Several key elements are present during the process of developing a Product Roadmap: strategy information, organizational initiatives, product vision, success criteria, market forces, product releases and known features, and timelines.

**Inputs:**

- **Org Goals &amp; Objectives:** identify the deliverables for the project. Products are developed to solve a business need.
-  Required Capabilities and Features:** output of 4.3

**       **

**Output:**

**•        Product Roadmap:** provides a high-level view of product features, along with the sequence in which the features will be built and delivered. It is also used to communicate how a product will develop and mature over time. Product roadmaps are used as a planning tool to understand a product and how it will support organizational strategy as it is further refined.



**4.6        ASSEMBLE BUSINESS CASE**

 Is the process of producing researched and analyzed information to support the organization&#39;s business goals and objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it helps organizations examine projects and products in a consistent manner, enabling the decision makers to determine whether a program and or project is worth the required investment. If necessary, project&#39;s project manager will undertake this task prior and/or during the creation of the project charter for an entire project implementation.

 Common set of components in a business case may include the following: problem or opportunity, analysis of the situation, recommendation, and evaluation (metrics for evaluating how the solution contributes to goals and objectives).

 The business case is intended to be a living document that is consistently updated and referenced throughout a project. It may be necessary to review and update a business case based on what is discovered over time.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Org Goals &amp; Objectives        :** Section 4.3

- **Story Mapping**: is a technique used to sequence user stories, based upon business value and the order which their users typically perform them, so that teams can arrive at a shared understanding of what is being built. Stories written into a business case are typically written at a high level and may exist as epics (epics are later split into other epics or individual user stories).

**       **

**Outputs:**

- **Business Case:** provides a documented economic feasibility study, establishing the validity of the benefits, in terms of value, to be delivered by a project or product. An approved business case is used an input when creating a charter to initiate a project. Business cases are assembled as one of the final process steps in needs assessment.

Note from Ben: as business cases are an input to a Project Charter to verify at a high level that a project/product will provide value and worth an investment, it may be redundant, or not necessary, to reassess those high level valuations for each product or application after elicitation and analyzation of business processes, unless it&#39;s necessary to confirm initial business case assumptions.

- **Product Scope:**  are the features and functions that characterize a solution and are based on viable options from the process of Determine Viable Options and Provide Recommendation. At this point, product scope is understood at a high level by the capabilities and features associated with the options chosen. Product scope continues to be refined as the product team furthers analysis. Throughout an initiative, product scope may be revised in response to changing business needs, risks, or constraints imposed by budget or schedule.

**5        STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT**

 Is the process of determining how to best identify, engage, communicate, and analyze those stakeholders with an interest in the business solution. The Stakeholder Engagement process raises awareness about those who have a connection, either directly or indirectly, to the product(s) being produced. Stakeholder Engagement is about ensuring optimal representation and ongoing interest and involvement from the organization.

**5.1        IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS       **

 Is the process of identifying the individuals, groups, or organizations that may impact, are impacted, or are perceived to be impacted by a decision, activity or outcome of a project or product. Product stakeholders take part in the discovery of requirements and contribute in elicitation by sharing information from which product requirements are eventually formed.

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Results:** consist of the business analysis information obtained from competed elicitation activities. With continued collaboration with stakeholders, the elicitation results may aid in identifying additional stakeholders. Described in further detail in Section 6.3 &amp; 6.4
- **Situation Statement:** Section 4.2

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Brainstorming:** used to identify a list of ideas within a short period of time. During future state analysis, the product team conducts conversations about potential capabilities that the organization might consider for addressing the situation.
- **Interviews:** is a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders. Covered in Section 6.3
- **Organizational Charts:** are models that depict the reporting structure within an organization. Organizational charts may be used as a starting point or, when one is not accessible or nonexistent, new ones can be made and utilized to identify product stakeholders.
- **Process Flows:** visually document the steps or tasks that people perform in their jobs or when they interact with a product. These models are typically well understood by business stakeholders.
- **Questionnaires &amp; Surveys:** Described in Section 6.3.9. They are written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Surveys can be used to collect information to establish or maintain a stakeholder list.

**       **

**Output:**

- **Stakeholder Register:** is a product/project document that includes the identification, assessment, and classification of stakeholders.



**5.2        CONDUCT STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS       **

**       ** Is the process of researching and analyzing quantitative and qualitative information about the individuals, groups, or organizations that may impact, are impacted or are perceived to be impacted by the product. The key benefit of this process is that it provides important insights about stakeholders that can be used when choosing elicitation and analysis techniques, and determining the best communication and collaboration methods to use.

 This process is performed to systematically and iteratively revisited throughout the project. As refinements are made to the product scope, the addition or removal of stakeholders may occur. Early planning may produce an initial stakeholder list, but further identification will maintain it.

 There are a few characteristics that may be analyzed during stakeholder analysis to develop clear insights about the identified stakeholders. The information from this analysis may help with decision making when establishing roles and responsibilities and determining how best to engage and collaborate with stakeholders. Some of these characteristics might include the following: attitude, experience, interests, level of influence.

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Results:**  consist of the business analysis information obtained from competed elicitation activities. With continued collaboration with stakeholders, the elicitation results may aid in identifying additional stakeholders. Described in further detail in Sections 6.3 &amp; 6.4
- **Situation Statement:** Section 4.2
- **Stakeholder Register:** is a product document that includes the identification, assessment and classification of project/product stakeholders. The stakeholder register provides the most current list of stakeholders for performing stakeholder analysis.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

It can be used during business analysis to gain insights into stakeholder roles, which may be helpful when the product may revise a workflow or business process, or create new roles.
- **Persona Analysis:** is a fictional character created to represent an individual or group of stakeholders, termed a user class. A persona may include any number of descriptive features the team decides are worth capturing – for example, a name, narrative, goals, behaviors, motivations, hobbies, environment, demographics, and skills. The persona narrative tells a story about the user class. The objective is to draw out stakeholder requirements to determine how a user class interacts with a solution. This tool may be used in product development or IT systems to design or map out user experiences and workflows.
- **RACI Model:** is a type of responsibility assignment matrix that uses Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform designations to define the involvement of stakeholders in activities. It can be used to communicate the roles and responsibilities of those involved in the business analysis effort. This tool may minimize confusion of roles, conflicts and areas where responsibilities overlap.
- **Stakeholder Maps:** are a collection of techniques used for analyzing how stakeholders relate to one another and to the solution under analysis.

**       **

**Output:**

**•        Updated Stakeholder Register:** the results of stakeholder analysis may include that addition or modification of any supporting information pertaining to stakeholder characteristics. Maintaining an accurate stakeholder register is critical to successful business analysis because the oversight of any one stakeholder could result in the loss of critical product requirements.



**5.3        DETERMINE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT &amp; COMMUNICATION APPROACH**

 Is the process of developing appropriate methods to effectively engage and communicate with stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle, based on an analysis of their needs, interest, and roles within the business analysis process. The purpose of this process is that it provides an approach to engage stakeholders through the requirements discovery activities, so that stakeholders receive the proper information with the best communication method to satisfy stakeholder expectations. This process means developing various methods to achieve optimal levels of commitment from stakeholders at appropriate points in the product lifecycle. Planning for stakeholder engagement and communication is critical for the success of product development.

**       **

**Inputs:**

**       **

**Output:**

**•        Stakeholder Approach:** Summarizes levels of involvement for stakeholders or stakeholder groups; how product information is structured, stored and maintained; and how stakeholders are kept up to date about information regarding product development efforts.



**5.4        CONDUCT BUSINESS ANALYSIS PLANNING**

**       ** Is the process of achieving an agreed upon approach regarding how business analysis activities the team will complete to successfully complete the work. The results of this process are assembled into a business analysis plan that may be formally documented and approved on how the team operates. Whether the plan is formally documented or not, the results from all of the planning processes should be considered in the overall approach. The key benefit of this process is that it encourages discussions to set expectations on how business analysis work will be undertaken and avoids confusion regarding roles and responsibilities.

 The approach associated with these processes are accomplished in different ways for efforts that use a plan-driven and predictive life cycle, as opposed to a change-driven and adaptive life cycle approach.

**       **

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Business Analysis Performance Assessment:** summarizes what has been learned about the effectiveness of the business analysis processes and techniques used in past efforts. As part ofplanning for an upcoming effort, previous assessments may suggest ways to adapt the planning effort to optimize their value in working with stakeholders. Covered in more detail in 5.7

- **Planning Approaches from other Knowledge Areas:**
  - Stakeholder engagement and communication approach (5.3)
  - Elicitation approach (6.1)
  - Traceability and monitoring approach (8.1)
  - Solution evaluation approach (9.2)
- **Product Risk Analysis:** includes the consolidated results from identifying and analyzing product risks.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Burndown Charts:** is a graphical representation used to count the remaining quantity of trackable aspects of a project or product over time. Typically teams working in an adaptive life cycle use burndown charts to track the remaining product backlog items from iteration to iteration.
- **Decomposition Model:** is an analysis model used to break down information described at a high level into a hierarchy of smaller, more discrete parts.
- **Estimation Techniques:**
  -  Affinity estimating**: a form of relative estimation, here team members organize product backlog items into groups where each backlog item is about the same size, or where team members use the notion of T-shirt sizes (small, medium, large, extra-large)
  -  Bottom-up estimating:** a method of estimating duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower level tasks.
  -  Delphi:**  used to support gaining consensus through anonymous estimating and decision making.
  -  Estimation poker:** a collaborative technique using relative estimation where there is an agreed-upon scale.
  -  Relative estimation:** a technique for creating estimates that are derived from performing a comparison against historical data.
  -  Wide-Band Delphi:** a variation of the Delphi technique where there is more communication and interpersonal collaboration to bring convergence to widely differing estimates.
- **Planning Techniques:** may include one or more of the following:
  -  Product backlog:** a list of all product backlog items, typically user stories, requirements, or features, that need to be delivered for a solution. Individual items are estimated, prioritized in order, and committed by a team to deliver in an iteration.
  -  Rolling wave planning:**  is an iterative planning technique where work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, where work in the future is planned at a higher level. For planning within an adaptive life cycle, rolling wave planning can be used at the release level to determine those features and functions for the current or next release. Similarly, progressive elaboration or further analysis identifies the specific features and epics to be included in the current release.
  -  Story mapping:** a technique used in planning for projects that use an adaptive life cycle. Story mapping is used to sequence user stories, based on business value and in the order users typically perform them, so that teams can arrive at a shared understanding of what will be built. From a business analysis perspective, story mapping can help suggest when more effort may need to be spent on analysis.
  -  Work breakdown structure (WBS):** a technique used for predictive life cycles. It is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be accomplished by a project team to create the required deliverables.

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•        Business Analysis Plan:** covers the entire business analysis approach, from stakeholder engagement to the decisions about how to manage requirements.



**5.5        PREPARE FOR TRANSITION TO FUTURE STATE       **

**       ** Is the process of determining whether the organization is ready for a transition and how the organization will move from the current to the future state. The key benefit of this process is so the organization can successfully adopt the changes resulting from the implementation of the solution or product.

**       ** Preparing for transition involves assessing the readiness of the organization to successfully transition from product development to operations and creating a plan to identify the requirements for making the transition successful. The readiness assessment is used to identify any gaps in readiness that are considered risks to achieve end state. Transition requirements describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and training requirements, and operational changes needed to transition from the current state to future state. Transition requirements may also be discovered while modeling, defining, and elaborating product requirements.

 Success product releases depend on delivering the solution with tits expected capabilities and preparing the people who are going to use it. For some products, a successful release also depends upon having the operational environment set up or converted.

**Inputs:**

- **Business Case:** section 4.6
- **Current State Assessment:** section 4.2
- **Product Risk Analysis:** includes the consolidated results from identifying and analyzing product risks. Described in Section 7.8

- **Business Analysis Organizational Standards:** may include expectation for how business analysis will be conducted and what tools might be used to support business analysis efforts.
- **Business Analysis Performance Metrics:** are qualitative or quantitative measurements used to evaluate the effectiveness of business analysis practices. Some metrics may include: percentage of requirements defects, percentage of missed requirements, number of missed objectives, and slippage in delivery dates of business analysis deliverables. When looking at any of these metrics associated with performance, it is important to be cautious because these metrics rarely isolate poor business analysis practices as the sole cause of development problems.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Burndown Charts:** section 5.2
- **Elicitation Techniques:** section 6.3
- **Process Flows:** section 7.2

**6        ELICITATION**

Is that activity of drawing out information from stakeholders. Stakeholders often have wants, needs, and ideas, but may not be able to express them clearly. Elicitation is the back-and-forth interaction between business analyst and stakeholders to obtain a shared understanding of product information.

Elicitation is highly cyclical and is repeated multiple times for each level of abstraction in product information. For instance, elicitation may be performed to collect business requirements from stakeholders, and once again for more detailed product requirements. Even when elicitation is being performed to understand a single concept, such as current state of an existing process, the processes are iterated through multiple times to obtain perspectives from different sources or to fill in gaps. Elicitation is also performed iteratively with analysis to progressively elaborate information.



**6.1        DETERMINE ELICITATION APPROACH       **

**       ** Is the process of thinking though how elicitation activities will be conducted, which stakeholders will be involved, which techniques may be used, and the order in which the elicitation activities are best performed. The key benefits of this process are efficient use of stakeholder time, effective stakeholder collaboration, and an organized approach to elicitation.

 The elicitation approach is used to formulate how to structure the elicitation activities and to think through how best to coordinate and conduct elicitation. Some elements in an elicitation approach include:

-
  - What information to elicit
  - Where to find information
  - How to obtain the information

A well-though out approach to elicitation provides the following benefits:

- **••** Clear ides of the necessary information to define a problem, effect an improvement or produce a solution
- **••** Minimization of unnecessary elicitation activities
- **••** Efficient use of stakeholder time
- **••** Valuable results from each elicitation activity
- **••** Better focus on the entire elicitation process

**Inputs:**

- **Product Scope ****:** section 4.6. Is defined as the features and functions that characterize a solution. The product scope provides context and defines the boundaries to determine what information to elicit with the goal of further detailing the scope items. **       **
- **Situation Statement ****:**  section 4.1 **       **
- **Stakeholder Eng ****agement**  **&amp; Comm**** unication **** Approach ****:** section 5.3
- **Ap ****proach       **
- **Stakeholder Register ****:** section 5.2.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Brainstorming**
- **Interviews ****:** is performed by asking questions &amp; documenting responses. The business analyst may want to interview subject matter experts to discover other sources of information to elicit from, to obtain stakeholder preferences for the elicitation process, stakeholder experience, and comfort level with elicitation techniques used/considered.
- **Retrospectives &amp; Lessons Learned ****:** section 5.7.

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•        Elicitation Approach**** :** describes how elicitation will be performed, what information to elicit, where to find the information, how to obtain the information, and when to conduct the elicitation activities. This output may be documented, or can be a thought process performed to prepare for the forthcoming elicitation effort.

**6.2        PREPARE FOR ELICITATION**

**       ** Is the process of organizing and scheduling resources and preparing necessary materials for individual elicitation activity. The key benefits of this process are that the elicitation activities are organized and effectively performed and stakeholders understand up front why they are involved and what is required of them. Preparation materials are for the benefit of the facilitator to ensure that the elicitation is conducted effectively and time spent with stakeholders is efficiently used.

 The following activities may be performed to prepare for an elicitation activity:

-
  - Determine the objective: set an objective for each elicitation activity
  - Determine the participants
  - Identify the resources
  - Identify the questions for the elicitation activity
  - Set the agenda
  - Schedule the elicitation activity

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Approach ****:** section 6.1. Explains how elicitation will be performed. **       **
- **Product Scope ****:** section 4.6 **       **
- **Require ****ments &amp; Other Product Information**** d Capabilities and Features ****:** section 7.3. It includes all the information about a solution and is the culmination of results from elicitation and analysis activities. **       **
- **Situation Statement ****:** section 4.1 **       **
- **Stakeholder Eng ****agement**  **&amp; Comm**** unication **** Approach ****:** section 5.3

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Document Analysis ****:** is an elicitation used to analyze existing documentation to identify relevant product information. It can be used to obtain information that is readily available that may result in reducing the amount of elicitation time needed with stakeholders.
- **Interviews ****:** section 6.3

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Elicitation Preparation Materials**** :** are items created to maximize the probability of meeting elicitation activity objectives, while optimizing the time spent with stakeholders. Preparation materials may include: activity objectives, agenda, background information, questions to be discussed, ground rules for elicitation technique, presentation material (including models) to structure meetings.

**6.3        CONDUCT ELICITATION**

**       ** Is the process of applying various elicitation techniques to draw out information from stakeholders. The key benefit of this process is that it obtains information from the appropriate sources to sufficiently define and elaborate requirements and other product information.

 There are three stages during an elicitation activity that are applicable regardless of the elicitation technique used:

-
  - Introduction: sets the stage, place, and establishes the overall purpose for elicitation
  - Body: where the question are asked and answers are given
  - Close: a graceful termination to the particular activity

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Preparation Materials ****:** Section 6.2 **       **
- **Product Scope ****:**  section 4.6 **       **
- **Situation Statement ****:** section 4.1

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Brainstorming ****:** Section 5.1
- **Collaborative Games ****:** are a collection of elicitation techniques that foster collaboration, innovation, and creativity to achieve the goal of the elicitation activity. Collaborative games are used to encourage team participation and enhance engagement. A few examples of collaborative games are:
  - Product Box: game to focus on design of a product. Split participants into teams and see who designs the best box.
  - Speedboat: This game focuses on aspects of a product that participants find problematic. Problems are represented as an anchor on a picture with multiple anchors attached to a boat. Team assess how much faster a boat will go if an anchor were removed.
  - Spider Web: technique used to discover unknown relationships between the product being analyzed and other products. Used to compare different products where the ideal group is the user or customer.
- **Document Analysis ****:** is an elicitation technique used to analyze existing documentation to identify relevant product information. When using document analysis, it&#39;s important to recognize the accuracy and relevancy of the information being used. Current state documentation may represent business or technical constraints that no longer apply.
- **Facilitated Workshops ****:** structured meetings led by a skilled, neutral facilitator.
- **Focus Groups**
- **Interviews ****:**  is a formal or informal approach used to elicit information from stakeholders. It&#39;s performed by asking either prepared or spontaneous questions and documenting the responses.
- **Observation ****:** is an elicitation technique that provides a direct way of obtaining information about how a process is performed or a product is used by viewing individuals in their own environment. It is particularly helpful to observe detailed processes because stakeholders may have difficulty recalling specifics when discussing their work. Stakeholders may also be unaware of their actions or inactions and therefore may be unable to communicate them. Observation is usually performed when the observer is viewing the process worker perform the work, but it can also be performed with the observer performing the tasks firsthand. Main drawback is that people behave differently when they are being observed.
- **Prototyping ****:** is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected solution before building it. This provides an opportunity to validate a conceptual working solution against a set of requirements to look for potential gaps in requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive elaboration through iterative cycles of mockup creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision.
- **Questionnaires &amp; Surveys ****:** are written sets of questions designed to quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents.

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•        Unconfirmed Elicitation Results**** :**  consist of the information obtained from completed elicitation activities. These results may be documented either formally or informally.



**6.4        CONFIRMED ELICITATION RESULTS**

**       ** Is the process of performing follow-up activities on previous elicitation results by reviewing with stakeholders the completeness and accuracy of the information. The key benefit of this process is that it validates that stakeholders and the elicitation results were understood during elicitation.

 During elicitation, information may be captured via multiple types of media, such as: whiteboards, flipcharts, meeting notes, and recording devices. Elicitation results may need to be:

-
  - Refined and/or corrected and extraneous information eliminated
  - Organized, categorized, and consolidated
  - Compared against previously elicited information

-
  - Converted to a level of formality based on stakeholder needs
  - Packaged for distribution

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Preparation Materials ****:** section 6.2 **       **
- **Unconfirmed Elicitation Results ****:** section 6.3 **       **

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Document Analysis ****:** section 6.3
- **Glossary ****:**  ** ** is a list of definitions for terms and acronyms about a product. The glossary is used to provide the product team with a common understanding about the terms being used in conversations and throughout other business analysis outputs. In section 7.3
- **Interviews ****:** section 6.3
- **Observation ****:** section 6.3
- **Walkthroughs ****:** is a peer review in which the author of the materials walks the peer reviewers through the authored information. A walkthrough may be conducted to review the elicitation results for accuracy, or to clarify any discrepancies. In section 7.3

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•        Confirmed Elicitation Results**** :** consist of the business analysis information from completed elicitation activities. Confirmed elicitation results signify that the product team has reached a common understanding of the information elicited. Confirmed results may be obtained after a group of stakeholders reviews the materials provided upon completion of elicitation or they can be obtained concurrently as elicitation is performed.

**7**** ANALYSIS**

  Is the process of examining, breaking down, synthesizing, and clarifying information to further understand, complete, and improve it. Analysis completes the set of product information by ensuring that it is correct and can be traced to goals.

**7.1        DETERMINE ANALYSIS APPROACH**

**       ** Is the process of thinking ahead about how analysis will be performed, including what will be performed and analyzed, which model will be beneficial to produce, and how information will be verified, validated, and prioritized. The key benefit to this process is that is supports a shared understanding of the business analysis work to be performed to develop the solution.

 The analysis approach identifies the relevant types of product information that will be considered, including the requirements attributes that need to be captured, and an explanation about how product information will be verified, validated, and prioritized. In adaptive delivery product life cycles, user stories may be stated as ready, not ready, or done, where done is tied to the delivery and acceptance of that portion of the product requirement.

 The analysis approach also identifies which activities are pertinent, templates to start from when documenting requirements, tools to use, and how any of these may be modified.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Elicitation Approach ****:** section 6.1 **       **
- **Product Scope ****:** section 4.6 **       **
- **Situation Statement ****:** section 4.1 **       **
- **Traceability and Monitoring Approach ****:** defines the traceability and change management processes for the project or product. Covered in section 8.1.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Brainstorming ****:** section 5.1
- **Document Analysis ****:** section 6.3
- **Retrospectives &amp; Lessons Learned ****:** section 5.7

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•        Analysis Approach**** :** describes how analysis will be performed; how to verify, validate, and prioritize requirements and other product information; how risks will be identified &amp; analyzed; how design options will be assessed; and which techniques and templates are expected to be used to perform analysis.



**7.2        CREATE &amp; ANALYZE MODELS**

**       ** Is the process of creating structured and visual representations, such as diagrams, tables, or structured text, of any product information to facilitate further analysis by identifying gaps in information. The key benefit of this process is that it helps convey information in an organized manner that provides clarity and helps achieve correctness and completeness.

 This process includes both developing and analysis models determined by the approach to improve the overall product information. Models provide context to discussions and provide for better understanding of complex relationships and concepts. Often, models can convey information more clearly than textual descriptions and can clarify and discover information with stakeholders. Analyzing models involves looking at a few pieces of information, not necessarily the whole set of information, and finding patterns to explore the problem space further.

 Drafts of models are created based on the confirmed elicitation results. Those models might go back through elicitation sessions to identify new information to be refined and reanalyzed. This process is often performed concurrently with the processes of Verify and Validate Requirements (sections 7.5 &amp; 7.6).

No situation requires all types of models listed below to be used. Some models are more useful in certain situations than others. Business analysis involves choosing the models that are most useful given what is known about the situation. Models are organized into five categories:

  - Scope models (bounding the solution)
  - Process models (how the solution will be used)
  - Rule models (rules the solution needs to enforce)
  - Data models (used in a process system and its life cycle)
  - Interface models (how the solution interacts with other systems and users)

**Inputs:**

- **Analysis Approach ****:** section 7.1 **       **
- **Confirmed Elicitation Results ****:** section 6.4 **       **
- **Require ****ments and Other Product Information**** d Capabilities and Features ****:** include all information about a solution and is the culmination of results from elicitation and analysis activities. Further described in section 7.3.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Context Diagram ****:** is a scope model that shows the direct system and human interfaces to systems within a solution. Generally, context diagrams are created early to identify interface and data requirements.
- **Data Dictionary ****:** is a model that lists data fields and their attributes and is usually created after other data models have been created.
- **Data Flow Diagram ****:**  is a model that is used to describe the movement of data between external entities, data stores, and processes.
- **Decision Tree and Decision Table ****:** are rule models that show a series of decision and the outcomes of those decisions. Decision trees visually show the flow of decisions and choices that lead to an outcome. Decision tables are useful for ensuring the business analyst has considered all possible combinations of decision scenarios and related outcomes. Decision trees are usually easier for stakeholders to review. Both models are useful as a foundation for test case creation with each combination of decisions and outcomes being a test case.
- **Ecosystem Map ****:** is a scope model that shows all the relevant systems, their relationships between systems, and any data objects to pass between them. Ecosystem maps are most useful when they are created at the beginning of projects to understand all the systems that may be affected by, or that will impact the in-scope systems.
- **Entity Relationship Diagram ****:** aka business data diagram. Is a data model that shows the business data objects or pieces of information of interest in a product and the primary relationships between those objects.
- **Event List ****:**  is a scope model that describes any external events that trigger solution behavior and help define the in-scope events that the solution has to react to or handle.
- **Feature Model ****:**  is a scope model that visually represents all the features of a solution arranged in a tree or hierarchical structure. Feature models are helpful to show how features are grouped together and which are sub-features of other ones.
- **Goal Model and Business Objectives Model ****:** are scope models that organize and reflect goals and business objectives in relation to other product information.
- **Modeling Elaboration ****:** is a technique that uses the collection of models together to further identify gaps, inconsistencies, or redundancies in product informant.
  - Traceability matrix: a table that connects or traces links between items. Business analyst use traceability matrices to trace requirements backward to features and business objectives, or forwards to develop artifacts or test cases. ** **
- **Organizational **** C ****c**** hart ****:** is a cope model that shows the reporting structure within an organization. They are used to identify who might be impacted by a solution and help when looking to identify user groups that have security and permission requirements.
- **Process Flows ****:** are used to visually document the steps or tasks that people perform in their jobs or interact with a solution. Process flows might be created as both as-is and to-be representations of the business processes so that changes to current solutions can be shown visually.
  - Value stream maps: shows any delays, queues, or handoffs and is used to identify any time spent that does not add value.
  - Activity diagrams: generally used to show complex flow of use cases. They are similar to process flows in syntax, but show user and system interactions in one diagram and mirror the textual description of use cases.

- **Prototypes, Wireframes, and Display-Action-Response- Models ****:** are all interface models.
  - Prototypes: is a representation of the expected solution before it&#39;s built. Prototypes can be low fidelity, such as a sketch of a screen layout, or high fidelity, such as an interactive user interface.
  - Wireframe: is a type of prototype, specifically a mockup of a user interface design and used to show what a screen should look like.
  - Display-action-response: is always used in conjunction with a prototype or wireframe to connect the user interface element requirements to a visual representation.
- **Report Table ****:** is an interface model that describes detailed requirements for a single report. It typically accompanies a prototype of a report to show implementation teams what the report should look like.
- **State Table and State Diagram ****:** are both models that show the valid states of an object and any allowed transitions between those states and describe all states within a solution that a single object can hold. These allow a business analyst to consider each potential state transition to determine if the transition should be allowed.
- **Story Mapping ****:** is a technique used to sequence user stories, based on their business value and the order in which their users typically perform them, so that teams can understand what will be built. Story maps help break capabilities down into user stories and can be used to identify gaps in capabilities. Story maps include two foundational parts: the backbone and the walking skeleton. The backbone is the minimum set of capabilities that absolutely have to be in the first release of the solution to serve its purpose and is known as the minimum viable product (MVP). The walking skeleton is the full set of end-to-end functionality that the stakeholders require for the solution to be accepted or considered functional. ** **
- **System Interface Table ****:** is a model that captures all the detailed level requirements for a single system interface and include information such as data fields passed from one system to another, the frequency and volume of the data passed, and validation rules.
- **Use Case Diagram ****:** is a scope model that shows all the in-scope use cases for a solution and involves listing users and possible scenarios of how each user will use the solution.
- **User Interface Flow ****:** is an interface model that displays specific user interfaces and commonly used screens within a functional design and plots out how to navigate between them. These are typically created after process flows and use cases to ensure that navigation in the system is logical and correct.

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Analysis Model**** s ****:** are visual representations of product information. This output reflects the total sum of all models created. Models show the solution from multiple facets and allow the business analyst to identify the gaps in process flows and requirements.

**7.3        DEFINE &amp; ELABORATE REQUIREMENTS**

**       ** Is the process of refining and documenting requirements and other types of product information at the appropriate level of detail, format, and level of formality required for various audiences. The key benefits of this process are that it helps clarify details about the product information so the team can work from it effectively, and stores product information is a manner that can be accessed and processed by all stakeholders.

 This process entails understanding and analyzing information discovered during elicitation, model analysis, and relationship dependency analysis to identify and write requirements and performed at different times to identify stakeholders, solutions, and transition requirements. In an adaptive approach, this process may be performed to define and elaborate user stories and the formation for any of those requirement types. The analysis performed also provides attribute values.

 Other processes that may be performed concurrently are: verify requirements (7.5), validate requirements (7.6), prioritize requirements &amp; other product information (7.7), and identify and analyze product risks (7.8). Define acceptance criteria (7.4) may be appropriate to perform at the same time by defining user stories.

 Defining and elaborating requirements includes defining all types of product information, not just requirements. The product information commonly includes: assumptions, constraints, dependencies, issues, and product risks.

 The total culmination of all product information is called a requirements package. It does not have to be, and often is not, a formal document. It could be user stories and relation information stored and evolving in a backlog.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Analysis Approach ****:** defines how analysis will be performed for the project or products and is a decision about the types of requirements to be elaborated and how they will be stored. Section 7.1 **       **
- **Analysis Models ****:** section 7.2 **       **
- **Confirmed Elicitation Results ****:** section 6.3 **       **
- **Relationships and Dependencies ****:** define the links between requirements. Covered in more detail in section 8.2. **       **
- **Stakeholder Eng ****agement**  **&amp; Comm**** unication **** Approach ****:** section 5.3

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Business Rules Catalog ****:** is a type of rule model that is a table listing business rules and attributes that describe how to constrain or support behaviors within the operation of a business. These business rules will be implemented or enforced by the solution/product.
- **Definition of Ready ****:** is a series of conditions that the entire team agrees to complete before a user story is considered sufficiently understood so that work can begin to construct it. Definition of ready helps the project team know that the user story is ready to be brought into an iteration (sprint). Covered in section 7.4.
- **Glossary ****:** is a list of all definitions for terms and acronyms about a product.
- **Product Backlog ****:** is the list of all items, typically user stories, that need to be delivered for a solution that describe the functionality that the business wants to see in a product. The items can be requirements for the solution to be built, as well as any issues or defects that have to be resolved from previous iterations. As new backlog items are added, the product backlog should be repeatedly refined. Backlog management is covered in section 7.7.
- **Requirements Management Tool ****:** allows requirements and other product information to be captured and stored in a repository.
- **Story Elaboration ****:** is the process by which user stories are further detailed with additional information until they are ready for development. Story elaboration is known as backlog refinement. Section 7.4
- **Story Slicing ****:** is a technique used to split epics or user stories from a higher level to a lower level.
- **Use Case ****:** is a process model that uses textual narratives to describe the system-user interactions to achieve successful completion of a goal. This model is frequently used to identify and elaborate requirements.
- **User Story ****:** is a method to document stakeholder requirements from the user&#39;s point of view with a focus on the value or benefit achieved by the user with the completion of that story. User stories help bridge business requirements to solution requirements.

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Requirements &amp; Other Product Information**** :** the output of this process are the requirements themselves.



**7.4        DEFINE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**

**       ** Is the process of gaining an understanding of the criteria that make up various aspects of a solution and what must be developed to meet the business objective. The key benefit of this process is that it provides insights that help refine requirements while providing the basis of a shared understanding for what is to be delivered.

 Acceptance criteria are the conditions that need to be met before a solution is accepted. Acceptance criteria form the basis of acceptance test and are important in evaluating the solution during product review sessions, where the product owner or business stakeholders decide whether to accept and release the developed solution. Acceptance criteria can be created at different levels, including: requirement, iteration, release, and product levels. In adaptive approaches, acceptance criteria may be written at the level of a user story, where multiple acceptance criteria need to be met for the user story to be accepted.

**       **

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Analysis Approach ****:** section 7.1 **       **
- **Analysis Models ****:** section 7.2 **       **
- **Require ****ments &amp; Other Product Information:** section 7.3 **d Capabilities and Features       **
- **Solution Evaluation Approach ****:** defines what types of metrics will be used to measure the performance of a solution. Covered in section 9.2.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Behavior-Driven Development ****:** is an approach that suggests that the team should begin with the understanding how the user will use a product, write tests for the behavior, and then construct solutions against the tests. It encourages conversation between the user or customer who needs to be satisfied with the solution and those who are implementing the solution. This approach is a continuation of test-driven development. Behavior-driven development approach includes a commonly accepted syntax to write acceptance criteria for user stories.
- **Definition of Done ****:** is a series of conditions that the entire team agrees to complete before an item is considered sufficiently developed to be accepted by the business stakeholders. It helps a project team know that the work is complete so the team can move on to the next user story or iteration (sprint). They are often defined at the user story level, iteration level, release level, and product level.
- **Story Elaboration ****:** is the process by which user stories are supplemented with additional information from conversations with business stakeholders, until they are sufficiently detailed for product development to begin work. In adaptive approaches, user stories are commonly written at a higher level of detail than functional and nonfunctional requirements, so story elaboration is the technique used to add the extra details for each story so that development teams have enough detail and information to build the solution.

**       **

**Outputs:**

**•       **  **Required Capabilities &amp; Features**** Acceptance Criteria:** are concrete and demonstrable conditions about an item that need to be met for the business stakeholders to accept the item. The definition of done is part of this output.



**7.5        VERIFY REQUIREMENTS**

**       ** Is the process of checking that requirements are of sufficient quality. The key benefit of this process is that is increases the likelihood that the requirements are stated and/or understood in a way that meets the defined standard for the organization which results in the communication of requirements to all interested parties, and contributes to the quality of the final product.

 Verification is the process of reviewing the requirements and other product information for errors, conflicts and adherence to quality standards. Verification also involves evaluating whether requirements and other product information comply with a regulation, specification, or imposed condition. In contrast validation is the assurance that a product meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders.

 Verification is performed to insure that the requirements and other product information are constructed properly and that the models are clear enough to be used effectively. To a certain degree, the author of the materials can do some verification, however, verification is also performed by someone else who is not on the project. Product verification that does not pass the verification steps needs to be elaborated or rewritten so that it can be deemed of sufficient quality. At the basic level, the standard for evaluating the information are the 3C&#39;s: correct, complete, and consistent.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Analysis Approach ****:** section 7.1 **       **
- **Business Analysis **** Org ****Organizational**  **Standards**** : **describe any expected quality, formatting rules, syntax rules, and requirements structure imposed by the organization. These standards define what a good requirement set is and may be based on industry standards.****
- **Compliance **** or Regulator ****y**  **Standards**** : ****** are imposed by external organizations, commonly for reasons related to security, protecting personal information, legal considerations, or safety reasons. Most often they are government or industry regulations.
- **Requir ****ements &amp; Other Product Information:** section 7.3 **ed Capabilities and Features**

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **INVEST ****:** describes the characteristics that user stories need to demonstrate to be considered &quot;good&quot; and &quot;ready&quot; for development. INVEST stands for:
  - Independent – the characteristic that breaks as many dependencies between user stories as possible so that it can be built by itself.
  - Negotiable – ensures that too much information is not captured up from, because all user stories and detail surrounding them should be negotiable between the development team and business stakeholders until enough information is known and accepted for development.
  - Valuable – where each story has value to the business or customer and the backlog is ranked based on that value.
  - Estimable (or estimate-able) – ensures that user stories have enough detail for the development team to provide a rough estimate of size. If the development team cannot size the story, there is not enough detail.
  - Small – means that the story is small enough for the development team to complete within a single time-boxed iteration.
  - Testable – determines whether a story can be finitely tested by a test team and the customer understands how to accept the requirement as done. Usually written as acceptance criteria.
- **Peer Reviews ****:** involve one or more coworkers reviewing the work completed by the business analyst. Commonly, the peer who performs the review is another business analyst, team lead, or quality control team member. Reviewers focus on the logic and readability of the requirements and looking for consistency with in the requirements for avoid contradictions. Often, business analysts will have an informal peer review meeting before reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure that issues are resolved.

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Verified Requirements &amp; Other Product Information**** :** include product information that has been evaluated to insure that it is free form errors and addresses the quality standards to which the information will be held. Verified requirements are not a guarantee that they address the business needs. The requirements also have to be validated, prioritized, and approved.



**7.6        VALIDATE REQUIREMENTS       **

**       ** Is the process of checking that the requirements meet the business goals and objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it minimizes the risks of missing stakeholder expectations or delivering the wrong solution (BB note: this is alleviated in Scrum as a Product Owner is responsible for the backlog and validating stories before they are built).

 The main goal of validating the product information is to come to a common understanding with the business stakeholders that the solution will address and support the business goals and objectives. Most validation requires participation from stakeholders.

**Inputs:**

- **Acceptance Criteria ****:** section 7.4 **       **
- **Analysis Approach ****:** section 7.1 **       **
- **Business Goals &amp; Objectives ****:** section 4.3 **       **
- **Require ****ments &amp; Other Product Information**** d Capabilities and Features ****:** section 7.3

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Delphi ****:** a consensus building method that consolidates anonymous input from subject matte experts. Covered in more detail in section 8.3
- **Goal Model &amp; Business Objectives **** Model:** section 7.2
- **Model**
- **Traceability Matrix ****:** is a grid that allows linkages between objects. It can be used to trace requirements to analysis models or downstream items such as test cases. This analysis ensures that each requirement traces directly back to support a business requirement. More information in section 8.2.
- **Walkthroughs ****:** are used to review the requirements with the stakeholders and to receive confirmation that the requirements as stated are valid. Walkthroughs entail holding a meeting to review the requirements as a group to ensure there is a common understanding of the requirements or user stories (BB note: OTS refers to this tool as a meeting called Backlog Refinement).

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Validated Requirements &amp; Other Product Information**** :** include product information that the stakeholder agree meets the business goals and objectives. The requirements also have to be verified, prioritized, and approved. When requirements and other product information are used as inputs into other processes, the inputs might include product information that has been validated.



**7.7        PRIORITIZE REQUIREMENTS &amp; OTHER PRODUCT INFORMATION**

**       ** Is the process of understanding how individual pieces of product information achieve stakeholder objectives, and by using those pieces of information, facilitate the ranking of work or user stories. The key benefit of this process is that it aligns all stakeholders with how the requirements achieve the goals and objectives and determines how to allocate the requirements to iterations.

 Prioritizing requirements is an important step in managing product scope and determines what should be worked on first or next so that business objectives are achieved in an order that best meets the needs of the organization and focusing on what add value the most. Prioritization also supports the allocation of requirements to iterations or releases for planning purposes.

 Business analyst might recommend prioritization, but it is necessary for accountable stakeholders (product owner) who have the authority to prioritize requirement to be involved in the process. Business analyst facilitate and negotiate prioritization decisions. Setting expectations on prioritization will minimize stakeholder becoming unsatisfied when their requirements are sent to the bottom of the list.

**Inputs:**

- **Analysis Approach ****:** section 7.1 **       **
- **Business Goals &amp; Objectives ****:** section 4.3 **       **
- **Change Requests ****:** are appeals to make a change to a requirement or product information that are raised by business stakeholders or project team after a set of requirements have been baselined. Stakeholder requests may be written as a user story and reprioritization occurs during the planning session for the next iteration. Covered in section 8.4 **       **
- **Relationships and Dependencies ****:** define the links between requirements. Section 8.2. **       **
- **Require ****ments and other Product Information**** :** section 7.3.

**d**  **Capabilities and Features**

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Backlog Management ****:** the product backlog needs to be organized by priority at all times. The list is ranked in order of business value or importance. Section 7.3.
- **Goal Model &amp; Business Objectives **** Model:** section 7.2.
- **Iteration Planning ****:** or sprint planning is the activity used to identify the subset of product backlog items that the product development team will work on for the current iteration or sprint. The entire team selects the backlog items that should be part of an iteration or sprint. Business analysis activities ensures the backlog items are ready to be developed.
- **Kanban Board ****:** is used in adaptive approaches to track work that is in progress by the project team. It is a visual representation of what work is in progress and workflows, such as project/product lifecycle phases.
- **Prioritization Schemes ****:** are different methods used to prioritize product requirements and other product information. A few commonly used schemes are:
  - Buy a feature – a game used to enable a group of stakeholders to agree on prioritization by providing each stakeholder with pretend money to buy their choice of features.
  - Delphi-  section 8.3
  - Minimum Viable Product – a prioritization mechanism used to define the scope of the first release of a solution by identifying the fewest number of features that would constitute a solution and brings the most quantifiable value to the business. The point of utilizing this technique is to realize business value faster than waiting for a full product to be built.
  - MoSCoW– a technique that categorized each requirement into one of the following: must have, should have, could have, and won&#39;t have.
  - Multivoting – a method also called dot voting because it can be performed by providing stakeholder with a prescribed number of dots and allowing them to vote by placing their dots on the requirements that they feel are the most important.
  - Purpose alignment model – provides a framework for categorizing business options by their purpose.
  - Timeboxing – an estimation or planning technique that can be used during prioritization by setting a strict time limit and prioritizing only the work that the team can complete in that duration of time.
  - Weighted ranking – a method that first requires decision criteria to be identified and weighted. Section 4.4.
  - Weighted shortest job first – a method used to rank stories based on more dimensions than business value and effort. It works by having team vote by using numbers similar to a Fibonacci sequence used in estimation poker. It&#39;s formulated as: WSJF = [business value + time criticality + (risk reduction/opportunity enablement)] / effort.
- **Story Mapping ****:** section 7.2.
- **Traceability Matrix ****:** a table that connects or traces links between items. Business analyst use traceability matrices to trace requirements backward to features and business objectives, or forwards to develop artifacts or test cases. Section 8.2.

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Prioritized Requirements &amp; Other Product Information**** :** are a representation of which requirements and other product information the stakeholders agree are most important to address first to achieve the business goals and objectives. The result of prioritization might describe what work should be completed next, or full ordering of all work, with items allocated to iteration or releases.

**7.8        IDENTIFY &amp; ANALYZE PRODUCT RISKS**

**       ** Is the process of uncovering and examining assumption and examining uncertainties that could positively or negatively affect success in the definition, development, and expected results of the solution. The key benefits of this process are that it supports proactive management of uncertainties in business analysis activities and addresses potential strengths and weaknesses in the product. Product risks are uncertainties that can affect the success and results of the product or solution and can lead to failures in the product if they are not addressed.

 Identifying and analyzing product risks includes the following activities:

-
  - Identifying product risks – documenting their characteristics, which may affect business analysis activities and/or the product.
  - Performing qualitative risk analysis – prioritizing product risks for further analysis and assessing their probability of occurrence and impact
  - Performing quantitative risk analysis – numerically analyzing the effect of identified product risks
  - Planning risk responses – developing options and actions to address product risks. Responses may include modifying or identifying additional product requirements to take advantage of opportunities or address potential failure points. Product risk management leads to identifying and proactively resolving gaps in requirements and product information.
    - **--** Strategies for negative risks or threats include: avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept
    - **--** Strategies for positive risks or opportunities include: exploit, enhance, share, and accept
  - Implementing risk responses
  - Monitoring risks – monitoring the implementation of agreed upon risk responses.

When identifying and analyzing product risks, consideration is provided to any applicable assumptions, constraints, dependencies, or issues.

-
  - Assumptions – factors that are considered true, real, or certain without actual proof.
  - Constraints – limiting factors that affect the execution of a project or product.
  - Dependencies – logical relationships that exist between two or more entities. Risks can be identified for situation if dependencies are not met.
  - Issues – points or matter in question, dispute, or not settled and under discussion.

**7.9        ASSESS PRODUCT DESIGN OPTIONS**

**       **

**       ** Is the process of identifying, analyzing, and comparing solution design options based on the business goals and objectives, expected costs of implementation, feasibility and associated risks, and using the assessment results of this assessment to provide recommendations regarding the design options presented. The key benefit of this process is that it allows for informed recommendations of design options.

 Assessing product design goes beyond what the product should do and starts to focus on how it should be built or how it should look. This process details how designs would evolve into a solution or product. Each option&#39;s analysis results may provide relevant information to articulate the pros, cons, risks, and costs of the option. Design discussions need to take place before construction begins for any given product, even if it&#39;s only a small piece. Product design assessments can be conducted concurrently to building requirements.

**Inputs:**

- **Business Goals &amp; Objectives ****:** section 4.3 **       **

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Viable Product Design Options**** :** are representations of how the solution could be constructed and are those options that have been reviewed by stakeholders to ensure that they achieve the business goals and objectives. Once a design is selected, construction of the solution or component of the solution can begin.



**8        TRACEABILITY &amp; MONITORING**

**       **  **       ** Includes the processes used to establish relationships and dependencies between requirements and other product information, and will help insure requirements are approved, managed, and impacts to changes are assessed. Traceability is the ability to track information across the product life cycle by establishing linkages, known as relationships &amp; dependencies, between objects. Traceability may be bidirectional, forward, and backward, because requirements are traced in more than one direction. For example, backwards traceability is from the requirements to the scope features. Traceability enables the discovery of missing and extraneous requirements.

Monitoring ensures that product information remains accurate from the point when product information has been approved through its implementation. It involves managing changes to product information and determining action to maintain the quality of the product.

**8.1        DETERMINE TRACEABILITY &amp; MONITORING APPROACH**

**       ** Is the process of considering how traceability will be performed on the project/product, and defining how requirement changes will be managed. The key benefit of this process is that it appropriately sized the level of traceability and formality of the requirements change management process for the situation.

 Each determine traceability and monitoring approach should be structured at a level of formality that meets the needs of a project/product. A traceability process minimizes the likelihood of missing requirements in the final product, and is not time consuming and wasteful to maintain. A change management process ensures that changes align with the business objectives, and is simple to implement necessary changes. Components of this approach related to traceability may include:

-
  - Types of object to be traced
  - Level of detail needed in traceability
  - Relationships that will be established and maintained
  - Where relationships will be tracked (e.g. requirements mgmt. tool)
  - Requirement life cycle states (maturity model)
  - How requirements changes will be proposed
  - How changes will be reviewed and documented
  - How requirement changes will be communicated
  - Roles &amp; responsibilities for the requirements change process.

The traceability approach defines the requirements architecture that will be used to specify how requirements, models, and other product information will be related to one another, including which components of product information will be most appropriate to trace and how the will be traced to one another.  Traceability is not limited to tracing product information. It may be performed on deliverables, components of work such as product design or development.

The change management process defines how changes to product information will be handled across the project. Adaptive approaches expect that requirements will evolve over time.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Compliance Standards ****:** are imposed by external organizations, commonly for reasons related to security, protecting personal information, legal considerations, or safety reasons. Most often they are government or industry regulations. **       **
- **Configuration Management Standards ****:** is a collection of formal documents, processes, templates, and documentation used to apply governance to changes to the solution or product under development. It ensures that the product being built conforms to its approved requirements. When such standards are not in place, the team needs to determine what the configuration management process will be for all aspects of the project, including the business analysis processes.

Components of the approach include types of object to trace, types of relationships, the level of tracing detail required, and where tracing information will be tracked.

**8.2        ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS &amp; DEPENDENCIES**

**       ** Is the process of tracing or setting linkages between and among requirements and other product information. The key benefits of this process are that it helps in checking that each requirement adds business value and supports controlling of product scope.

 As product information is progressively elaborated, and additional information surfaces, relationships and dependencies are created and revisited. Product information is traces to help provide and complete views of the product scope. Linkages among different components of product information help do the following:

-
  -         ** Ensure the product information adds business value – tracing each component of product information helps ensure its relevancy.
  - Manage scope – non-value-added product information is highlighted through product information that cannot be traced back to the product scope and business goals and objectives.
  - Minimizes the probability of missing requirements
  - Perform impact analysis
  - Make release decisions

Sometimes a requirement is not able to be satisfies in a solution without including the other requirements to which it is related. Some relationships are as follows: subsets, implementation dependency, and benefit or value dependency.

They are established to help ensure that product information adds business value and meets customer expectations, manages scope, decreases the probability of missing requirements, performs impact analysis, and makes release decisions.



**8.3        SELECT &amp; APPROVE REQUIREMENTS**

**       **

**       ** Is the process of facilitating discussions with stakeholders to negotiate and confirm which requirements should be incorporated within an iteration, release, or project. The key benefit of this process is that is provides authorization to consider how and when to build all or part of a solution to develop or modify a product. Approving requirements is performed to obtain agreement that the requirements accurately depict what the product team is being asked to build. On projects using an adaptive life cycle, requirements are effectively baselined when they are identified as planned work to be addressed in the next or subsequent iteration.

 Business analyst includes facilitating discussions among stakeholders to work through different viewpoints and conflicts in requirements and to negotiate an agreed upon outcome, and ultimately, approval.

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Approved Requirements**  **are:** verified, in that the requirements are of sufficient quality; and validated, in that the requirements meet business needs.

 Approved requirements are an indication that those with the authority to approve requirements have agreed to what the development team should build. This can be represented by a prioritized backlog ready for development or stories chosen from the product backlog as the planned work for the next subsequent iteration.



**8.4        MANAGE CHANGES TO REQUIREMENTS &amp; OTHER PRODUCT INFORMATION**

**       ** Is the process of examining changes or defects that arise during a project by understanding the value and impact of the changes. As changes are agreed upon, information about those changes is reflected wherever necessary to support prioritization and eventual product development. The key benefits of this process include facilitating the incorporation of important solution changes, limiting unnecessary changes, and providing understanding of how change will impact the end product.

  On adaptive project, change is ongoing. The team utilizes emergent learning, where stakeholders discover their requirements as portions of the solution are delivered over time. A prioritization process is used to determine if and when a change is considered for inclusion in the product.

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Recommended Changes to Requirements**** :** describe the course of action that is proposed after analyzing all the impacts associated with making a proposed change, including impacts to a product and project scope. The possible courses of action regarding a change include: approving, deferring, rejecting, or requesting additional information before making a decision.

**9        SOLUTION EVALUATION**

**       ** Includes the processes to validate a full solution or a segment of a solution that is about to be or has already been implemented. Evaluation determines how well a solution meets the business needs expressed by stakeholders, including delivering value to the customer or user and consists of the work done to analyze measurements obtained for the solution by comparing actual results of acceptance testing to the expected or desired values, as defined by the acceptance criteria.

 Preparation for evaluating a solution includes defining and confirming the expected business, value, and identifying and defining what kind of performance data will be used for evaluation. For projects and products, the following can be stated with regard to solution evaluation:

-
  - To identify new or changed requirements, which may lead to solution refinement or new solutions.
  - Can provide input into go/no-go business and technical decisions when releasing an entire solution or a segment of it.
  - May identify a point of diminishing returns, such as the point where additional value that could be obtained from a solution does not justify the additional effort.
  - Can be the basis for follow-up activities

**9.1        EVALUATE SOLUTION PERFORMANCE**

**       ** Is the process of evaluating a solution to determine whether the implemented solution, or component, is delivering the business value as intended. The key benefit of this process is that the analysis provides tangible data to determine whether the solution that the business has invested is achieving the expected results.

 Evaluation of solution performance typically occurs after a solution has been released. Business analysis techniques are used to analyze variation between desired and actual results as part of assessing the business value of the solution. Because many measurements need to take place after a solution has been released, it may take a long duration of time to assess the solution, and will require organizational commitments to measure those business values.

**       **

**Inputs:**

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Assessment of Business Value**** :** is the result from comparing the expected business value form a solution against the actual value that has been realized. The assessment is used to make decisions about whether to develop a new product or to enhance, retire, or discontinue an existing product.



**9.2        DETERMINE SOLUTION EVALUATI**** ON ****NG**  **APPROACH**

**       ** is the process of determining which aspects of the organization and/or solution will be evaluated, how and when performance will be measured, and by whom. The key benefit of this process is that performance indicators and metrics are selected or defined so they can be collected and reported on, and evaluated to support continual improvement of the organization or product.

 Solution evaluation approach should be defined as early as possible because there may be risks that when needed at a later product life cycle phase, it will be expensive or impossible to obtain.

**       **

**Inputs:**

- **Metrics and KPIs ****:** is a set of quantifiable measurements used to evaluate a solution or business. In solution evaluation, a metric defines how solution performance can be quantified. Key performance indicators are a related type of metric, usually defines by an organization&#39;s executives, use to evaluate the organization&#39;s progress toward meeting its objectives or goals. **       **

**•        Solution Evaluation Approach**** :** describes when and how a solution will be evaluated, the types of metrics that will support evaluation, the feasibility of collecting and communicating the performance data, and who is responsible for conducting the evaluation and communicating the results.

**9.3        EVALUATE ACCEPTANCE RESULTS &amp; ADDRESS DEFECTS**

**       **

**       ** Is the process of deciding what to do with the results from a comparison of the defined acceptance criteria against the solution. The key benefit of this process is that it allows informed decision making about whether to release all or part of a solution and whether to undertake changes, or enhancements to the product.

 This process compares the acceptance criteria and the actual results of acceptance testing to provide recommendations on how to deal with situations where aspects of a solution do not meet the acceptance criteria specified for it. It focuses on the actual results from comparing acceptance testing to their acceptance criteria, rather on the tests themselves. This distinction supports common practice in the industry, where organizations distinguish between roles that conduct business analysis and roles that perform testing.

 The test results that are part of evaluating acceptance criteria and addressing defects may come from:

-
  - Exploratory tests and user acceptance
  - Day-in-the-life tests
  - Preproduction or simulated production testing
  - Tests of functionality with a scenario
  - Tests of nonfunctional requirements

For solutions that involve software, where an organization has adopted automated regression testing, it may be possible to spot trends and patterns in out-of-tolerance results.

**Inputs:**

- **Acceptance Criteria ****:** section 7.4
- **Actual Acceptance Results ****:** contain pass/fail results from comparing test results against the acceptance criteria, often provided by a quality control team. In business analysis, the actual acceptance results are then analyzed to determine the reasons for any differences between the test results and acceptance criteria and to recommend how to address the defects.

**Tools &amp; Techniques:**

- **Prioritization Schemes ****:** section 7.7
- **Root Cause Analysis ****:**  section 4.2
- **Traceability Matrix ****:** section 8.2
- **Variance Analysis ****:** section 5.7

**       **

**Output**** s ****:**

**•        Evaluated Acceptance Results**** :** provide a summarized comparison between the acceptance criteria and the actual acceptance results, along with the root cause for variances or defects, the analysis of the cost to address the defect, and the business impact of addressing it or accepting it.



**9.4        OBTAIN SOLUTION ACCEPTANCE FOR RELEASE**

**       ** Is the process of facilitating a decision on whether to release a partial or full solution into production and eventually to an operation team, as well as transitioning knowledge and existing information about the product, its risks, known issues, and any workarounds that may have arisen in response to those issues. The key benefit of this process is the creation of an agreed-upon break between building a solution and releasing a solution for acceptance by the stakeholders.

 Obtaining solution acceptance for a release provides the stakeholders who are accountable for the product with an opportunity to decide whether it should be released in whole, in part, or not at all. For solution acceptance, the term _release_ may refer to releasing a solution or a segment of a solution into a production environment while its development team is still responsible for it. It can also refer to releasing a solution or a segment of it to the operational area who will take responsibility for it.

 Release decisions are typically based upon:

-
  - Acceptability of a solution, as evidenced by the evaluated acceptance results
  -  Confirmation that the organization is ready for release
  - Confirmation that the transition activities for the release have been completed to the degree necessary
  - Acceptance of any remaining product risks and workarounds

A decision to release a solution to its operational area requires confirmation of the completion of any warranty period. A warranty period is an interval of time during which the product development team is responsible for addressing any defects found after the solution is released for production.
